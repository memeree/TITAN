## Overview & Problem Statement 

My Background - I've worked as a Business Analyst for circa 10 years, for various companies and more recently for the NHS (UK Public Health body). 
I've seen firsthand how challenging this environment is, and the cost pressures they are under, whilst being undervalued, and underpaid. Corona has taken a toll on everyone. 

I want to help them manage their staff better, and money, in order to be more efficient, whilst working to decrease the burden of outdated tech that they have to use, which doesn't add value to their lives or organisations - the more money they have left over, the more money they can pay their employees - WIN WIN.
